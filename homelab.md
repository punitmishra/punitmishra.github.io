## Setting up a SD Card to Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server Release).
Keeping things simple. Installing (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) 

Atleast at the time of writing this: 
[https://ubuntu.com/download/server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)

```bash
Get Ubuntu Server
Option 2: Manual server installation
USB or DVD image based physical install

OS security guaranteed until April 2027
Extended security maintenance until April 2032
Commercial support for enterprise customers
```

Going with Option #2. (Manual Install). 
- I am already on a ubuntu machine (will keep things more simple and use the startup disk creator and use the iso to make a SD card with ubuntu server installed).
