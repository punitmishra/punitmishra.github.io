## About Me

Greetings! I'm Punit, an Engineer by profession. By day, I engage in crafting applications, sculpting lightweight and scalable infrastructures, and delving into machine learning challenges at SAP, my current abode. During my off-hours, I immerse myself in the realms of web3, blockchain technologies, cultivate "pi-net" projects, tinker with Wi-Fi routers, intercept data packets, and experiment with all things electrically powered. My academic journey culminated in a Bachelor of Science - BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) from the distinguished University of California @ Berkeley in 2012. I share my life with Pepper (affectionately known as Mr. Pepper), my faithful companion of approximately 13.5 years.

In pursuit of channeling energies into meaningful endeavors, I seek to document and index significant facets of life on this very platform, steering clear of Xbox distractions.
