## About Punit

**Punit**, an Engineer with a passion for innovation.

Hello!  I'm Punit, and by day, I'm an engineer at **SAP** where I tackle challenging problems that involve building applications, creating robust infrastructures, and exploring the exciting world of machine learning.  When I'm not coding, I delve into the ever-evolving landscape of **web3**, tinker with **blockchain technologies**, and explore the possibilities of **open hardware**.  I'm also a huge fan of "pi-net" projects, and I can often be found tinkering with Wi-Fi routers, analyzing data packets, and experimenting with various electrical devices.  My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) from the University of California, Berkeley (Go Bears!), class of 2012.  My furry companion and partner-in-crime throughout these adventures is my beloved dog, Pepper, or as I affectionately call him, Mr. Pepper.
