# About Punit

## Engineer

Hello! I'm **Punit**, an engineer with a drive for exploring cutting-edge technologies and solving complex problems. Currently, I work at **SAP**, where I dive into building innovative applications, creating robust **infrastructures**, and pushing the boundaries of **machine learning**. Outside of work, my interests span the dynamic realms of **web3**, **blockchain**, and **open hardware**.

I also love working on "pi-net" projects. Whether it's configuring Wi-Fi routers, analyzing data packets, or experimenting with various electrical devices, you'll often find me in my home lab exploring new tech. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2012 (Go Bears!). Throughout this journey, my loyal sidekick has been my dog, Pepper – or as I like to call him, Mr. Pepper.

### Programming Languages

---

I have a passion for exploring different programming languages and diving deep into their nuances. Here's a quick overview of my favorites:

- **Rust** – For high-performance and memory-safe applications. It's my new found love.
- **Python** – My go-to language for data analysis, machine learning, and quick prototyping.
- **C/C++** – C will always be my favorite of all time. For system-level programming and performance-critical tasks.
- **Java/Scala** – When I need to work on large-scale, distributed systems. Specially Spark - it's very easy to work with Scala and Spark together, and write some resiliant spark jobs.
- **React.js** - When I want do React work with **Next.js**
- **Vue.js** - Personally preferred to React but I use a mixed back. 
- **Go** – Ideal for building cloud-native applications and microservices. I use it mainly for tools I work with.

##### Code Snippets and Tutorials

I am starting to build my blog where I share recommended readings, clever hacks, and debugging techniques to help you master these languages. Here’s a sneak peek of what you'll find:

```rust
// Rust: A basic example of ownership and borrowing
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = &s1;
    println!("{}, world!", s2);
}
```

*(Check out the Programming Section for more snippets and in-depth tutorials.)*

##### DevOps Insights

My DevOps journey includes building CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and infrastructure as code. Here’s what I specialize in:


##### Continuous Integration (CI)
- **GitHub Actions**: Mastering workflows to automate builds, tests, and deployment processes.
- **Jenkins**: Setting up multi-branch pipelines for complex projects.

*(Check out my CI/CD Best Practices Guide for detailed steps and configurations.)*

---

##### Continuous Deployment (CD)

*(Stay tuned for upcoming insights on Continuous Deployment, including Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm deployments!)*

##### Testing
- **API Testing**: Using tools like Postman and Rest Assured for robust API validation.
- **UI Testing**: Implementing Selenium WebDriver for automated UI testing across multiple browsers.
- **Integration Testing**: Crafting end-to-end tests to ensure seamless interaction between components.

*(I'll soon be adding diagrams and short videos to illustrate these concepts in action.)*
