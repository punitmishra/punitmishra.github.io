- Making sure everything is resiliant enough. 
- High level network diagram.
- Making sure the pages really work.    
    ```bash
    echo "Here is the BINARY TEXT from header info png above"
    export BINARY_TXT="01001000 01101001 00100001 00100000 01010100 01101000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01010000 01110101 01101110 01101001 01110100 00101110 00100000 01001001 00100000 01100001 01101101 00100000 01100001 01101110 00100000 01000101 01101110 01100111 01101001 01101110 01100101 01100101 01110010 00101110"
