# Engineering Career Growth: What Actually Matters

*From problem selection to multiplier effects — lessons from 12+ years in software*

---

After 12+ years in software engineering, I've seen patterns in what separates engineers who grow continuously from those who plateau. Here's what I've learned.

## Technical Skills Are Table Stakes

Past a certain point, raw technical ability stops being the differentiator. Most senior engineers can learn any new technology given enough time. What matters more:

### 1. Problem Selection

Junior engineers solve assigned problems. Senior engineers identify which problems are worth solving.

```
Junior: "How do I implement this feature?"
Senior: "Should we implement this feature at all?"
Staff: "What problem are we actually trying to solve?"
```

The most impactful engineers I've worked with spend significant time understanding the problem space before writing any code.

### 2. Communication Clarity

Your ability to explain complex technical concepts to different audiences is career-defining:

- **To executives**: Business impact, risks, timelines
- **To product managers**: Trade-offs, constraints, alternatives
- **To other engineers**: Architecture decisions, implementation details
- **To yourself**: Written design docs force clarity

Writing is particularly undervalued. A well-written design doc or post-mortem demonstrates thinking quality in ways code can't.

### 3. Scope Management

The jump from senior to staff is largely about managing scope:

```
Senior: Delivers complex features end-to-end
Staff: Defines and shapes projects across teams
Principal: Sets technical direction for the organization
```

This means saying "no" more often than "yes." Every commitment has opportunity cost.

## The Multiplier Effect

Individual contribution has linear impact. Your goal should be multiplicative impact:

### Code Review as Teaching

```python
# Instead of just fixing issues:
"Change this to use a set for O(1) lookup"

# Explain the why:
"Consider using a set here - the current list lookup is O(n),
which becomes noticeable when processing large batches.
Sets give us O(1) average case, and the items are already
unique so we don't lose anything."
```

The second approach helps the other engineer make better decisions independently.

### Documentation Scales

Every hour spent on good documentation saves multiple hours across the team:

- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Runbooks for operational tasks
- Onboarding guides
- Post-mortems with clear lessons

### Mentorship Compounds

Time invested in others pays dividends:

- Pair programming sessions
- Career guidance conversations
- Sponsorship (advocating for others in rooms they're not in)

## What I Wish I'd Learned Earlier

### 1. Outcomes Over Output

Shipping code isn't the goal. Solving problems is.

Sometimes the best engineering decision is to buy instead of build, or to deprecate instead of maintain, or to have a difficult conversation instead of writing a technical solution.

### 2. Relationships Matter

Technical careers are not solo endeavors:

- Build trust with product and design partners
- Maintain relationships across teams
- Stay connected with former colleagues

The best opportunities come through relationships, not job boards.

### 3. Take Care of Yourself

Burnout is real and recovery is slow. Sustainable pace beats sprints:

- Set boundaries on work hours
- Take actual vacations
- Maintain interests outside of tech
- Exercise and sleep matter for cognitive performance

### 4. Own Your Career

Don't wait for your manager to hand you growth opportunities:

- Ask for the projects you want
- Propose solutions to problems you see
- Build skills outside your current role
- Have explicit career conversations

## Growth Isn't Always Up

The "ladder" metaphor is misleading. Growth can mean:

- Going deeper technically (IC track)
- Moving into management
- Changing domains or industries
- Starting something of your own
- Optimizing for work-life balance

All of these are valid paths. The key is intentionality—know what you want and work toward it.

## Practical Next Steps

**This week:**
- Write down your current role's scope and where you want it to be
- Identify one high-impact problem that isn't assigned to anyone
- Schedule a career conversation with your manager

**This month:**
- Write a design doc or ADR for something you're working on
- Give a tech talk or write a blog post
- Have a mentorship conversation (as mentor or mentee)

**This quarter:**
- Take on a project slightly outside your comfort zone
- Build a relationship with someone in a different part of the org
- Reflect on whether your current path aligns with your goals

## Final Thoughts

Career growth in engineering isn't about accumulating technologies or climbing titles. It's about continuously expanding your ability to have positive impact—on the product, on the team, on the organization.

The engineers I admire most share a common trait: they're genuinely curious and always learning. They've realized that the industry changes fast enough that standing still means falling behind.

Stay curious. Stay humble. Keep building.
